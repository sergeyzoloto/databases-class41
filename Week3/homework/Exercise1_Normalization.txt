1. What columns violate 1NF?

Columns food_code and food_description are not atomic (contain multiple values).
Column dinner_date has no single column domain.
There is no explicitly defined primary key. It is possible now to identify a unique combination of member_id and dinner_id, but the given data is already inconsistent and it is not going to work.

2. What entities do you recognize that could be extracted?

At this point there are members, dinners, venues, and food.

3. Name all the tables and columns that would make a 3NF compliant solution.

members_dict (member_id PK, member_name, member_address)
venues_dict (venue_id PK, venue_description)
food_dict (food_id PK, food_description)

dinners (dinner_id PK, dinner_date, venue_code FK)
orders (order_id PK, member_code FK, dinner_code FK)
meals (meal_id PK, order_code FK, food_code FK)
